# How to use the mod and import it inside your Opera GX.

Before that make sure:
You have developer mode on the extension mode.
If not, then select extensions, then Manage extensions, then enable developer mode in the right corner.

Steps:
- Download WinRAR. It's completely free and will cost you nothing. except you will want to buy license, but you don't really need that!
- Download one of the editions from this repository, and extract it to "archive-name-here.zip".
- Go to extensions tab (opera://extensions) and drag and drop the extracted archive, or just select "Load unpacked" and find your archive.
- Then you can go to mods tab (opera://mods) and configurate the whole mod.
